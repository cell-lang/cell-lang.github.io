<h2>Creating and using relational automata</h2>

<p>We're now going to see how relational automata are created and used. While we will focus here on how to do that in Cell, as opposed to doing it from the host language in mixed-language applications, all the commands we're going to describe have close equivalents in the interface of the generated code.</p>

<p>Automata of either type can only be created inside procedures and passed as arguments to other procedures, but not functions. A procedure can declare any number of automaton variables, but it cannot create them dynamically: all automaton variables are instantiated when a procedure is called, and automatically destroyed when it returns.</p>

<p>In order to see how to use relational automata, we'll write a tiny command line tool that is actually useful in practice. Our application will create a relational automaton, read an initial state for it from a file and a list of messages from another, send each message to the automaton instance in the given order, and save its final state in another file. We'll make use of the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Counter</span></code> automaton we saw in the previous chapters, but the code can be made to work with any automaton type with only trivial changes.</p>

<p>The first line in the body of <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Main(..)</span></code> is the declaration of the automaton variable <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>instance</span></code>, which looks like an ordinary variable declaration. Automaton variables are instantiated and initialized as soon as the procedure that hosts them is called, and their initial state is the one that is provided with the schema declaration, which in the case of <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Counter</span></code> is just <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>(value: 0, updates: 0)</span></code>.</p>

<p>The first step is to load the initial state for <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>counter</span></code> from the given file, check that it's a valid record using the runtime type check <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>init_state :: [Symbol -&gt; Any]</span></code> and set the state of <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>instance</span></code> with the command:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
<section>
<pre><code>ok = write instance &lt;- init_state;
</section>
</figure>
</code></pre>

<p><code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>ok</span></code> is a boolean variable that indicates whether the operation succeeded. It will fail if the provided value (<code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>init_state</span></code>, in this case) is not a valid state for the target automaton. That cannot be checked at compile time, for two different reasons. First of all, a schema definition includes integrity constraints (keys and foreign keys) that would be hard to check at compile time. The other reason is related to persistence, and will be discussed in detail in the next paragraph.</p>

<p>The state of any automaton can be set at any time, any number of times. It's just like setting the value of a variable of an atomic type (like booleans, integers or floating point numbers) in any other language. The next step is to load the list of messages and send them in the given order to <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>instance</span></code> with the instruction:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
<section>
<pre><code>ok = instance &lt;- msg;
</section>
</figure>
</code></pre>

<p>Here too the variable <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>ok</span></code> indicates whether the message was processed successfully. Also note the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>msg_list :: CounterMsg*</span></code> check, which is required to verify that whatever data was loaded from the input file was indeed a valid sequence of messages for <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Counter</span></code>.</p>

<p>When a message handler fails, you may need to figure out what went wrong. That's what the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Error(..)</span></code> builtin procedure is for:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
<section>
<pre><code>err_msg = <span class='m'>Error</span>(instance);
</section>
</figure>
</code></pre>

<p><code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Error</span></code> takes as argument an automaton instance, and returns a string explaining why the last update failed (if the last message was handled successfully, it just returns the empty string). An update can fail either because the corresponding message handler threw an exception during its execution, or because it violated an integrity constraint (a key or foreign key). In the first case the string returned by <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Error(..)</span></code> will simply contain the stack trace at the time the exception was thrown, but in the second one it will show which key or foreign key was violated, and the tuples that violated it. Be warned though that at the moment this feature is a bit buggy: the argument of the tuples may be in the wrong order, and their values may be incomplete. For example, in some cases a tuple of the form <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>user_id(3012), "ed86"</span></code> may be printed out as <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>"ed86", 3102</span></code>. That's still good enough for debugging purposes though, as long as you're aware of the problem.</p>

<p>The last instruction we have to manipulate relational automata is used to take a snapshot of the state of an automaton instance:</p>

<figure class="highlight">
<section>
<pre><code>final_state = read instance;
</section>
</figure>
</code></pre>

<p>As already explained in the previous chapters the state of an automaton cannot be aliased in any way, so making a copy of it requires making a physical copy of at least some of the underlying data structures that are used to store it. How much data exactly has to be copied depends on the implementation and the target language, but it generally is a rather expensive operation, especially if the automaton contains mutable relation variables. In the worst case, the entirety of the data structures that encode its state will have to be physically copied.</p>


<h3>Persistence and schema changes</h3>

<p>One advantage of having a structural data model and type system is that it becomes a lot easier to manipulate data whose exact structure is unknown. An example is the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>_parse_(..)</span></code> built-in function used in <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>ReadValueFromFile(..)</span></code> above: it can reconstruct any value from its textual representation, even if its type is unknown. Such a function cannot be implemented in most statically typed languages, which usually don't provide a way to create a value of a type (or an object of a class) that doesn't exist, or doesn't exist anymore.</p>

<p>That comes in handy when trying to reconstruct a copy of an automaton instance from its serialized form. As your application evolves, and the schemas it defines change with it, sooner or later you'll have to load the serialized state of an old version of a relational automaton into the new one. The two versions will be incompatible, in the sense that a value that is a valid state for either of them will not be a valid state for the other.</p>

<p>How do you deal with this problem in Cell? The first line of defense here is the structural data model. Even if the schema definition has changed or it has been renamed, and even if some of the types inside it are gone you'll still be able to easily reconstruct the value of its state.</p>

<p>Then you'll need to convert the old state into a new one. There's no magic bullet here unfortunately, but there are a number of schema changes the persistence layer of Cell can deal with automatically:</p>

<ul><li>If the new version of the schema contains a member variable that was not present in the old one, that variable is automatically initialized to its default value provided with its declaration.</li><li>A new mutable relation variable will be left empty. That means, for example, that you can add new entities, relationships and optional attributes to existing schemas without losing backward compatibility with your saved data</li><li>Any member variable or mutable relation variable that was removed from the schema is simply ignored.</li></ul>

<p>Another type of change that is not yet supported but which poses no conceptual problem and will be implemented soon(-ish) is the addition of a mandatory attribute that has a default value, which is almost the same thing as an optional attribute.</p>

<p>Other types of changes cannot be dealt with automatically and require the developer to provide the compiler with some extra information. The only option right now is to write a function that takes the value of the old state and converts into the new one. Other conversion mechanisms will be added at some point in the future: they probably won't save much effort compared to writing an explicit conversion function, but they might make the process more efficient in terms of memory usage, which would be an important advantage when dealing with large dataset or when operating in memory-constrained environments.</p>
