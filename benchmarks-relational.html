<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The benchmarks we'll be examining in this chapter are meant to tests the performance of code that updates and queries the state of relational automata, and compare it to equivalent hand-written Java or C# code (Benchmarks that test the functional subset of the language for purely computational tasks are available <a href='benchmarks-functional.html'>here</a>).</p>

<p>As we'll see, there are times when the Java code generated by the Cell compiler outperforms the hand-written one. Now, any claims of being able to outperform Java (or any other language) while compiling to it should always been taken with a grain of salt. The Java or C# code used for comparison is written in an object-oriented style using the collection library provided with the language, which is the style of programming those languages were designed for. It can certainly be made faster, for example by writing custom collection classes, or by steering clear of OOP altogether and using data-oriented design techniques instead, which is basically what the Cell compiler does. Doing so will certainly yield code that is consistently faster than anything the Cell compiler could generates, as one could copy all the compiler's tricks, add one's own, and also avoid many of the inefficiencies of the generated code. But that's a bit like fighting the language instead of working with it, and certainly involves a significant additional effort on the part of the programmer.</p>

<p>Compared to garbage-collected, object-oriented languages like Java or C#, Cell has a number of both structural advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance. One major disadvantage is the deferred update model of relational automata: when an instruction that updates a member or mutable relation variable is executed, the update is not applied immediately, but stored in temporary memory until the message handler returns, which obviously involves a certain amount of overhead. A separate but related source of overhead is support for transactions. Another disadvantage is that in Cell, you can (and usually will) specify a set of integrity constraints (that is, keys and foreign keys) on the state of relational automata that need to be checked at runtime.  A static analysis of the codebase can remove some of this overhead, but not all of it all the time. A more general problem is that mutability in Cell is subject to a number of restrictions that are bound to negatively affect performance in at least some situations.</p>

<p>On the other hand, relational automata naturally lend themselves to being implemented using techniques borrowed from the Entity/Component architecture and more generally from data-oriented design. One advantage of these architectures is that they vastly reduce the number of cache misses by improving the locality of the data. As we'll see later, they also seem to put less strain on the garbage collector, which is not suprising: having, say, a million instances of a class with five member variables in OOP means having a million distinct blocks of memory to keep track of, but with the E/C architecture you would end up with five arrays of one million elements each plus a hashtable (another array), which are much easier for the garbage collector to deal with.</p>

<p>While the code generated by the Cell compiler is already pretty fast, remember that optimization is still a work in progress: there's a lot left to do and, presumably, at least some margin for improvement. Among other things, the data structures used to implement ternary relations, while reasonably fast, are still too generic and don't take advantage of the specific usage of each individual relation variable and the constraints that are placed on it; many-to-many binary relations seem to have performance problems under deletion that haven't been investigated yet; the generated code still performs many useless integrity checks that could be eliminated by a more sophisticated static analysis; sending a message to an automaton currently involves more overhead that a method call in an imperative language, but in many cases that overhead could be eliminated; and several of the optimizations the compiler already performs would be more effective if combined with aggressive inlining of methods. The effects of these shortcomings are clearly visible in the example we will be examining.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider is that compiling to Java is far from being ideal. No garbage-collected, memory-safe language I know of would be ideal of course, but the lack of lightweight, non-heap-allocated data structures probably makes Java worst than most. Only compiling to C/C++ could fully take advantage, in terms of performance, of Cell's unique design, but the current C++ code generator hasn't been updated since version 0.1, is completely obsolete, uses inefficient data structures that were meant to be temporary, and does not optimize the generated code at all, although it still manages to beat the Java version for some workloads. It will be brought up to date again with the next (0.5) version of the language.</p>


<h3>The IMDB movie database</h3>

<p>This example will make use of a a subset of the data in the IMDB movie database. The dataset is contained in a number of CSV files of moderate size (~140 MB in total). The various versions of the code will parse and load the dataset into memory, run a number of queries on it and finally update it in various ways. Both the code and the dataset are available on <a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-imdb'>github</a> (the relevant files are <a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-imdb/blob/master/cell/main.cell'>main.cell</a> and <a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-imdb/blob/master/cell/imdb.cell'>imdb.cell</a> for Cell, <a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-imdb/blob/master/java/imdb.java'>imdb.java</a> for Java and <a href='https://github.com/cell-lang/example-imdb/blob/master/csharp/imdb.cs'>imdb.cs</a> for C#). If you have any questions or comments or if there's anything you would like to see added to this set of benchmarks, just leave a message in the <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cell-lang'>forum</a>.</p>

<p>All tests were run on a dual-core Intel Celeron 1005M running Lubuntu Linux 18.10, using either the Java HotSpot Server VM (version 12.0.1) or the .NET Core SDK (version 2.2.301). We will examine the single-core results first, since all versions of the code are single-threaded, and discuss dual-core performance later.</p>

<p>Each test was run 25 times, but the first 5 iteractions were discarded, so as to give the JVM/CLR time to warm up, and the remaining 20 were averaged. Cell took longer than Java to warm up (it's just more code) and C# took barely any time at all.</p>

<p>Here's the visual representation of the structure of input dataset:</p>

<p><div><img src='imdb.svg' style='width:100%'></div></p>

<p>and this is the definition of the relational automaton we'll be using to store it:</p>

<h3>Loading the dataset</h3>

<p>The first test consists of parsing each of the CSV files and inserting the data into the corresponding relation variables in the case of Cell, or creating and wiring the corresponding set of objects for Java and C#. The results are show in the following table (all times are in milliseconds):</p>

<p><table class='types-table'>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th class='number-header'>Cell</th>
    <th class='number-header'>Java</th>
    <th class='number-header'>C#</th>
    <th class='number-header'>Cell/Java</th>
    <th class='number-header'>Cell/C#</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>movies.csv</td>
    <td class='number'>402</td>
    <td class='number'>294</td>
    <td class='number'>1047</td>
    <td class='number'>1.36</td>
    <td class='number'>0.38</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actors.csv</td>
    <td class='number'>1936</td>
    <td class='number'>2478</td>
    <td class='number'>3994</td>
    <td class='number'>0.78</td>
    <td class='number'>0.48</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>directors.csv</td>
    <td class='number'>82</td>
    <td class='number'>98</td>
    <td class='number'>92</td>
    <td class='number'>0.83</td>
    <td class='number'>0.89</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>movies_directors.csv</td>
    <td class='number'>258</td>
    <td class='number'>208</td>
    <td class='number'>369</td>
    <td class='number'>1.24</td>
    <td class='number'>0.69</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>movies_genres.csv</td>
    <td class='number'>233</td>
    <td class='number'>126</td>
    <td class='number'>511</td>
    <td class='number'>1.84</td>
    <td class='number'>0.45</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>roles.csv</td>
    <td class='number'>8136</td>
    <td class='number'>5096</td>
    <td class='number'>9150</td>
    <td class='number'>1.59</td>
    <td class='number'>0.88</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td class='number'>11047</td>
    <td class='number'>8300</td>
    <td class='number'>15163</td>
    <td class='number'>1.33</td>
    <td class='number'>0.72</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>The first three columns show the loading times in milliseconds for each of the languages being tested, and the last two show the performance of the Cell code relative to Java and C# respectively (obviously a number greater than one means that Cell is slower, and conversely a number smaller than one that Cell is faster). Each row correspond to a different CSV file, save for the last one which shows the totals. As you can see Cell is generally slower than Java, and consistently faster than C#, but in either case the difference is not huge.</p>

<p>Note that the individual numbers in the above tables are not particularly reliable (only the totals are), because a lot depends on when the garbage collector decides to kick in, which varies depending on how the tests are set up. Since this phase of the test is dominated by object creation, which puts a lot of pressure on the garbage collector, it's actually interesting to see what the numbers would be in an "infinite memory" scenario, which can be approximated by setting (with the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>-Xms</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>-Xmx</span></code> options) the amount of memory available to the JVM to a sufficiently large amount, and by explicitly invoking the garbage collector before loading each individual file (obviously, the times spent doing the preventive garbage collection is not included in the figures shown here):</p>

<p><table class='types-table'>

</p>

<p>As you can see, with the garbage collector out of the way, Java is consistently and significantly faster than Cell, which is not particularly surprising: object creation is extremely fast in Java, while the data structures used by Cell are more complex, and updates are also slowed down by a number of factors (transactions, integrity checks, etc.) mentioned in the introduction. But much of that advantage is then lost by overloading the garbage collector.</p>

<p>This also shows where Cell lags the most compared to Java: loading the data in <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>roles.csv</span></code>. The vast majority of that time is spent updating the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>role</span></code> ternary relation. As already explained in the introduction, optimization of ternary relations is still a work in progress. Fixing that should be enough to close most of the performance gap between Cell and Java in this particular test.</p>


<h3>Updating the dataset</h3>

<p>We'll now be performing a number of update operation, that are described here:</p>

<ul><li>U1: Increments the rank of all movies released before a given year by a specified amount.</li><li>U2: For each actor, computes the average rank of the movies they appear in, and stores the result in the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>actor_rank</span></code> relation variable or in the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>avgMoviesRank</span></code> member variable.</li><li>U3: For each director, computes the average rank of the movies they directed, and stores the result in the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>director_rank</span></code> relation variable or in the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>avgMoviesRank</span></code> member variable.</li><li>U4: Randomly generates a list of movie ids, and for each of them increments their rank and updates the rank of all actors and directors that worked on it.</li><li>U5: Deletes all movies below a given rank.</li><li>U6: Deletes all actors that do not appear in at least one of the remaining movies.</li><li>U7: Deletes all directors that did not work on any of the remaining movies.</li></ul>

<p>The results are shown here:</p>

<p>As you can see, the performance of all three languages is in the same ballpark, except for updates <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>U5</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>U6</span></code> where Cell is significantly slower. For <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>U5</span></code> what seems to slow down the Cell implementation is deleting from <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>acted_in</span></code> (a many-to-many binary relation) and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>role</span></code> (a ternary relation). Both problems have already been mentioned in the introduction. The causes of the poor performance of <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>U6</span></code> haven't been investigated yet.</p>


<h3>Queries</h3>

<p>Let's now compare the performance of computation that does not update the dataset. We'll be running the following set of queries:</p>

<ul><li>Q1: Counting the number of movies whose rank is no less that a given threshold. Repeated for several different values of the threshold.</li><li>Q2: Counting the number of actors who played in at least one movie whose rank was no less than a given threshold. Repeated for several different values of the threshold.</li><li>Q3: For each actor, finding all co-actors in movies with a given minimum rank.</li><li>Q4: Calculating a histogram of movie ages.</li><li>Q5: Calculating the average age of all movies with a given minimum rank.</li><li>Q6: Calculating the sum of the ages of all movies in the dataset.</li><li>Q7: For each movie in a randomly generated set, finding all movies that have actors in common with it.</li><li>Q8: For each actor in a randomly generated set, retrieving the last names of all actors with the same first name. Duplicates are eliminated.</li><li>Q9: Same as Q3, but also returning the number of movies they appeared in together.</li><li>Q10: Same as Q8, but duplicates are not eliminated.</li><li>Q11: For each director, checking if they ever also worked as actors.</li><li>Q12: For each actor, computing the full name by concatenating first and last names.</li></ul>

<p>Some of the queries are a bit bizarre, but they actually manage to test all the basic operations on relations: attribute lookups, navigation, searches and linear scans. The results are shown here:</p>

Let's take a look at each of them in turn. <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Q9</span></code> makes use of a map/dictionary which is repeatedly mutated. In Cell maps only support functional updates, which are reasonably fast, but cannot compete with Java's mutable, hashtable-based maps. In <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Q10</span></code>, an optimization made by the Cell compiler clashes with the limitation of Java's object model. The same problem would not present itself when compiling to C/C++. In this specific case though, it could be solved with a more sophisticated analysis of the source code. <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Q12</span></code> is a special case: the cause of the bad performance is just a weird problem with string concatenation, that was discovered too late to be fixed in version 0.4. C# is also significantly faster for <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>Q11</span></code>, but the reasons for that haven't been properly investigated yet.</p>

<p>We can also run the same queries on the much smaller dataset that is the results of applying the updates described in the previous paragraph:</p>

<h3>Dual-core results</h3>

<p>The results we saw in the previous chapter were obtained by running the benchmarks on a single core, using the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>taskset</span></code> command. Even though none of the programs is multithreaded, we'll now take a look at what happens when we allow them to take advantage of both cores. Here are the loading times:</p>

<p>Cell is slightly slower in this case, and that's just what you would expect from a single-threaded program that is moved from core to core. C# is a lot faster, to the point that it achieves speed parity with Cell. It might be that it's able to run the garbage collector on the second core (as already explained, this part of the test puts a lot of strain on the garbage collector). Java, on the other hands, inexplicably takes nearly twice as long to complete the task, and is now the slowest of the three. This I've no idea what could be causing this behavior (if you know, or can guess, please leave a message on the <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cell-lang'>forum</a>). Let's now check the updates:</p>

<h3>Embedded mode</h3>

<p>Cell is primarily meant to be used as an embedded language, so we'll now take a look at its performance for that specific use case. This is the only part of the language that hasn't been optimized yet, and some of the numbers are pretty bad at the moment. Optimization of the "boundary" code is planned for the next release (0.5), and the results shown here are not, for the most part, indicative of what performance will be like once those optimizations have been implemented.</p>

<p>As one might expect, often performance takes a hit in embedded mode, because of all the data conversion and validation that take place at the boundary between handwritten and generated code.</p>

<p>Updates are affected especially badly, because at the moment any message sent to an automaton instance has to be passed to the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>execute()</span></code> method in textual form, so before it can be processed it has first to be reconstructed by parsing the given string, and then it has to be checked to make sure it's of the right type, and for simple message handlers execution times are often several times higher. This will be fixed in the next release, which will dispense with the need to pass the message as a string and the subsequent expensive parsing and validation.</p>

<p>But even once that's fixed, the public interface of relational automata will still have to be designed carefully in order to minimize the amount of data that has to be transferred between the hand-written and the generated parts of the codebase. Guidelines and examples of how to do so will be published after version 0.5 is out, but in practice that's easier than it sounds. That's because, even though it can be used to replace an embedded database, Cell is not a database but a fully-featured programming language, and computation that needs to access the data held by the Cell side of the code can, in the vast majority of cases, be done directly in Cell, without involving the host language. Most of the time, you'll need to transfer only data that is used for I/O operations, which cannot be done directly in Cell: for example, when such data has to be displayed to the user or sent to another computer or application. In those cases, the computational costs or the intrinsic latency of the I/O will typically dwarf the costs of the data conversions.</p>

<p>OK, enough excuses already, time to look at some numbers. Let's start with the loading times, which are especially brutal:</p>

<p><table class='types-table'>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th class='number-header'>Standalone</th>

<p>The first column shows the results when running the Cell-only program, and are exactly the same numbers we saw previously, the second column shows the result of running the tests in embedded mode, and the last one shows the ratio between the two. Again, these results are really bad, but they are not indicative of what performance will be in the next release. Updates look much better:</p>

<p>The only update that is significantly slower is U4, because in that case the same method is invoked repeatedly with different arguments, while all other updates consist of a single method call. In this particular case the performance problem should disappear completely in version 0.5. In case you're wondering why some operations look faster in embedded mode, that's probably just the garbage collector that kicks in at different times, skewing the results a bit. And finally, these are the results for our set of queries:</p>

<p>Apart from Q11 the queries that exhibit the worst slowdowns are Q8, Q10, Q12, which is not surprising, since they all do very little work but return a lot of data that needs to be converted. Q11 on the other hand is an example of a computation that is unnecessarily split between the Cell and Java sides of the code. The overhead almost entirely disappears if it is performed entirely in Cell.</p>


<h3>Saving and loading the dataset</h3>

<p>The last thing we need to check is how long it takes to load and save the dataset using the generated <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>void load(Reader)</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>void save(Writer)</span></code> methods. Those methods use the standard literal representation of Cell data, which is rather verbose: the ~140 MB of CSV files used as input increase in size to ~400 MB when saved in the standard Cell format. The updated version of the dataset, which is smaller, results in a file size of ~170 MB.</p>

<p>Saving the entire dataset takes between <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>10s</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>11s</span></code> on first run, which goes down to around <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>6.5s</span></code> once the JVM warms up on the machine used these tests. In order to get those results though, it's necessary to manually increase (with the <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>-Xms</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>-Xms</span></code> command line flags) the amount of memory used by the JVM, otherwise the number stays at <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>~10s</span></code> even after the JVM has warmed up. Saving the updated version of the dataset takes between <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>6s</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>7s</span></code> on first run, which goes down to less than <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>3s</span></code> after a couple iterations. There's no need to tweak the memory settings of the JVM in this case.</p>

<p>Loading the dataset takes around <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>25s</span></code> on first run, and about <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>15s</span></code> once the JVM has warmed up. The latter time is not too bad (it is, after all, more or less the same time it takes the handwritten C# code to load the data from the original CSV files), but since loading the data is typically one of the first things an application would do, in most cases you would be stuck with the cold-run performance. Loading the updated version of the dataset takes about <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>15s</span></code> seconds on the first run, and a little over <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>6s</span></code> seconds afterwards.</p>

<p>Here there's still room for improvement, for example by replacing <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>java.io.Reader</span></code> and <code class='inline-code-box'><span class='inline-code'>java.io.Writer</span></code> with the NIO API, and by switching to asynchronous I/O, and at least some of that will probably be implemented in the next release (0.5). The longer term solution though is to define a more compact binary format that is equivalent to the textual representation (with a tool to convert between the two) but faster to read and write.</p>
